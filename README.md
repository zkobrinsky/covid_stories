# COVID Stories

This app was built with the intent of making a sort of ["post secret"](postsecret.com) space for people's experiences in the COVID-19 world. The spirit of the app is to have an anonymous space where you can share stories without judgement or fear of retaliation. 

This is my second Flatiron project â€” the goal being understanding http routes, user validations, ActiveRecord, SQL and database management within a Sinatra framework. While it's meant to be an anonymous platform, you can create an account and manage your content, mostly out of an obligation to the project requirements.
